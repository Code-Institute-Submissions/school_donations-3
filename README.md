# School Donations Dashboard

## Overview

### What is this dashboard for?

The goal of this project was to expand my skill set and tools for creating a meaningful interactive data visualization.
To do this I used a data set from DonorsChoose.org to build a data visualization that represents school donations
broken down by different attributes over a time line.

### What does it do?

This project is intended to display data in a visually effective manner using responsive data visualizations.
It also includes a Dashboard tutorial which provides a step-by-step walk through for users.

### How does it work?

This projects uses Python Flask for building a server that interacts with Mongo DB and renders the html page that
contains charts. Using 3rd party CSS and JavaScript (__see **Tech Used**__), I created **graph.js** which contains the
logic and data binding for dashboard elements. I inject data from my python class into this file. The data will then be
filtered using crossfilter.js before being bound to the charts using a combinations of D3.js and DC.js. I also use
Queue.js, in case I need to read from additional datasources/apis's at a later date.

## Features

### Existing Features

1. Responsive data visualizations with two way data binding.
2. Visually effective presentation layer.
3. User step-by-step walk-through tour.

### Features Left to Implement

1. Fully responsive layout with mobile design.
2. Integration tests.

## Tech Used

### Some Tech Used Includes

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
    - A Python based micro-framework, **Flask** was used to serve data from to server to my web based interface.
- [Mongo DB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
    - A NoSQL Database, **Mongo DB** was used to convert and present my data in JSON format.
- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)
    - A JavaScript based visualization engine, **D3.js** renders interactive charts and graphs based on data.
- [Dc.js](https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/)
    - A JavaScript based wrapper library for D3.js, **Dc.js** make plotting charts a lot easier.
- [Crossfilter.js](http://square.github.io/crossfilter/)
    - A JavaScript based data manipulation library, **Crossfilter.js** enables two way data binding.
- [Queue.js](https://github.com/d3/d3-queue)
    - **Queue.js** is asynchronous helper library for JavaScript.
- [Intro.js](http://introjs.com/)
    - **Intro.js** is a JavaScript library that allows you to attach tooltips to divs, creating a step-by-step user guide.
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
    - **Bootstrap** is the most popular framework for developing responsive layouts.


## Contributing

### Getting the Code Up and Running
1. Firstly you will need to clone this repository by running the
```git clone https://github.com/meganduffy/school_donations.git``` command.
2. After you've done that you'll need to make sure that you have [**Mongo DB**](https://www.mongodb.com/) installed and
the mongoDB shell activated by running the command **mongod** in your Terminal/Command Prompt.
3. Leave the prompt running as it is and open another Terminal/Command Prompt.
4. Copy your csv data set file to the same location as the directory opened in the second terminal window.
5. Enter the following command: ```mongoimport -d donorsUSA -c projects --type csv --file <file name> --headerline```
There are over 87,000 records in the file, so it will take a few minutes to upload the data. You will see a progress
indicator in the terminal letting you know how much data has approximately been uploaded.
6. Open Mongo Management Studio to see the uploaded data. Itâ€™s now in JSON format.
7. In order to run the app locally enter the following values into **school_donations.py**: ```MONGODB_HOST = 'localhost'
MONGODB_PORT = 27017
DBS_NAME = 'donorsUSA'
COLLECTION_NAME = 'projects'```
Within the **donor_projects()** function enter the following values: ```connection = MongoClient(MONGODB_HOST, MONGODB_PORT)
   collection = connection[DBS_NAME][COLLECTION_NAME]```
8. Run **school_donations.py** in your IDE and - __volia!__ - the app should appear in your browser.
    - Give the app a few minutes for the data to load.
    - Make sure you have **mongod** running; otherwise you'll get no data back.
    - Turn off caching in your chrome developer tools. This prevents confusion and frustration of seeing out of date cached versions of your dashboard when developing.
